# Qualifications required

# Listening Script 
So, Phillipa, has your daughter decided what she wants to do when she finishes school? Yes, she has. She really wants to become a pilot.
She's studying very hard. Wow, that's awosome. There aren't many woman pilots you know?

What qualifications does she need to do that? Well, it's pretty difficult actually. She has to complete all secondary schooling
with at least 2 A levels in Math and Physics. What about a degree? Does she have to have degree as well?

No, not really. But it's recommanded as there is lots of competition. So her plan is to get a degree in aviation. and then go to flying school.

Sounds great. and What a great way to see the world! And get pay for it. Yes, I know. 
The only problem, though, is that she has to show that she can make difficult decision. And she is terrible at making decision working on the pressure.

No, she is not. She'll be fine. Yeah, I hope so. We've looked at a few application forms already
and They say that she must have perfect 20/20 vision and be in top medical condition so that's okey. When she finishes flying school,
She must have at least 3000 flying hours before she can become a first officer.

Wow, how exciting. Captain Thunder Hemmings, hey? I'll be so proud of her.
