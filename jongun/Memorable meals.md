One of the hightlight of trip for me was this meal we had one night **in a little town** by the sea. Oh, Yeah?
I really wanted to try this dish called 'fruits de mer'. It's basically a plate of defferent kinds of seafood on a bed of ice. 
Sounds Good. What seafood did you have? 
Loads! There were prawns, mussels, clams and a big crab - so much - It took Simon and I such a long time to finish it. 
But It was so good. Right, Wow.
Also the way they presented it all was really special. It was all arragned beautifully and the shef had put two sparklers in the middle. 
Sparkler? Yeah, I felt It was my birthday. Did you have anything else?
Well, We decided to share the dessert. So, I ordered the lemon tart. And you know what? Go on.
It was such a dispointment. It was a pizza base with sliced lemon on the top. I couldn't eat it, it was so bed.
Did you complain? No, I thought **It's supposed to be** like that. I thought if I complained, then Everyone would think 
I was some **ignorant** tourist. 
So what did you do? Well, I did't want to leave it all my plate. Because then the waiters might ask why we hadn't eaten it. 
So no one is looking, I warped it up in a papaer napkin and put it in my pocket and threw it in the bin once we were outside. 
No. Yes silly, wasn't it. 
Anyway, I think the horrible dessert was one of the reasons why it was such a memorable meal.
