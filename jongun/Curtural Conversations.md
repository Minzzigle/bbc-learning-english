What's your faverite Holyday? My faverite holyday is Thanksgiving. It's an important holyday in US on 4th thursday of November every 
year. People have the day off work and many travel with their families. The whole family gets together and eat a big dinner. The most 
traditional things to eat are turkey, and pumpkin pie.

That sounds like a nice holyday. I'd like to try those things. My family is from india and my faverite holyday is Holi.
It's on a different day every year. But It's near begining of the spring. Night before, people have bonfires and sing and dance.
Then the next morning, we run through the street with water and coloured powder and throw them at people.

It dosen't matter if you know them or not. It's so much fun. At the end, everyone is laughing and covered with colour.
And How about you, young. What's your faverite holyday?

My family is from China and my faverite holyday is chinase new year. It's the first day of luna calander. in January and February.

Everyone visits their families and eats dumplings. We also set off firecrackers.
