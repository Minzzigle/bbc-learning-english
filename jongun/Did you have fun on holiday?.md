Hey, welcome back! How was your holiday? I had lots of fun. I went to Thailand with some friends.
I hope the weather was better than it was here. It was raining here for a whole week.
Yes, the weather in Thailand was great. It was hot and sunny everyday! We spent a lots of time on the beach. 
We went swimming, and one day we took boat trip to an island. How was that?
Actually, I was feeling a little seasick for the first parts of trip, But then I got used to it.
The sea is so beautiful and then we got to the island. We saw some amazing ruins. We spent day on the island.
And then took boat to sunset. The sunset over the water is absolutely breathtaking. Sounds wonderful. 
Yes, it was. And I feel very well rested now.
