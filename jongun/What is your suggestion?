Well, so next step is where to go for our annual work trip. Any suggestions?
Personally, I think it would be great to go aborad again. How about going to Thailand? It's got great food and lots to do.
Um, I'm not so sure. It's bit of a long way to go for a short trip. Let's go to Tokyo. I'm sure we'll have great time and It's a shorter trip than Thailand.
And more expensive. Our budget could cover a weekend in Tokyo. Any other ideas?
If not Tokyo, I think Shanghai would be a good idea. It's cheaper, and closer than Bangkok or Tokyo. Plus, It's got lots of really exciting things to do.
Yes, I think Shanghai sounds good.
