I really enjoy that last speaker. He was so informative and he really seemed to be an export in his field. Will was at that Session, too. **What did you think of him**, Well?

Actully, I wasn't that impressed. I didn't really like his delivery style. He seemed a bit arrgont, as though he thought everyone shoud accept what he said without question. I didn't think Sam and Julie missed much by not going. Where were you two, by the way?

I went to a question and answer session. I liked it because it was more informal. it was nice to have a chance to discuss the things we learned over the last couple of days. What did you do, Julie?

To be honest, I've been really bored with the confernace. So I skipped the last session and went for a walk around the town. It's beautiful city although we didn't see much over it. I'm definitely coming back.
