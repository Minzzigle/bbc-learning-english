How do you like your first job? What do you do everyday?
I'm working as an office assistance. When i go in to work, I check my email and anwer the most important messages first.
Then, my boss usally ask me to make some copies or do some filing. On Wendnesday afternoon, We usally have staff meeting. 
And I have to send out email with the minute after the meeting. 
How long do you work everyday?
From nine to five. With an hour for lunch at noon. It's not a very exciting job. But I'm glad to get some work experience.
I've been so busy with my university classes this year. I have a class at 8:00am everyday of the week. And two evening, I also have
night classess from seven to nine. This week, I'm writing a research paper. I go to the libaray everyday to work on it. 
It's due at in the end of the month. And I can't hand it to late. I also need to prepare my exams.
