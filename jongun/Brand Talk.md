## Lintening Script

Ok, I like Apple Because they make really beautiful product. And their phones, their computers are really easy to use. 
Because they are well-made, and well-designed.
So l like that.

I'm not a big fan of Gucci. And a deginer-brand like that. Because I think people only buy them because of their status-symbal.
so they think it show off people how much money they have or something like that. Um, and i think they're terrible value 
I mean one handback cost ridiculous amount of money. So yeah, I don't like that.
