Right. So we find three courses we want to do this year. Customer service, business writing, and interview skills. Which one do you 
priortise, Aire.
Well, there are all good courses and very important. Training a writing will help a lot of stuff with emails, proposals, and reports. 
Everyone in the company will benefit.
Yes, That's true. But It'll take a long time. The interview skills training can be done quickly. And people can use it now.
What do you think?
I'm sure the interviewing skills will help teams to select better candidate. But in my opinion, the writing training will have more impact.
hum, you are right. But It'll take 6 months to deliver. My view is we do interview skills training now. Ok, why don't we do the 
writing training in 3 parts.
In between, we do interview skills and customer service. 
Yes, that's sound sensible. Ok, can you put back in the calender and we can present to the senior management?
Sure, Kalus.
