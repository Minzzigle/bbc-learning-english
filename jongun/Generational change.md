# Listening Script
Hello everyone. On today's show, I'm joined by Dr. Adam Crouch and Dr. Louise Dailly. Their new book, generational change, looks at
how socity has changed over the last twenty years. And they are going to talk about some of the points in the book. 
Doctors, thanks for coming in.
Thanks for inviting us on, Sue.  
So, perhaps you can tell us about some of the key areas you book discusses. 
Well, one of the key areas is social media and the fact that they are grown so much over the ten years.  
We are much more communicative when it comes to internet. On the other hands, some people feel we have actually become less chatty on
the face to face level.  
And Dr. Dailly, you also looks at style and dress code.
Yes, i did. And there have benn big changes. But not in the way some may think. In some places, work dress code have got less formal.
Steve jobs, at apple, and other executives started. And other offices have done the same. On the other hand, people we interviewed
believe people have started to be more stylish. Maybe even more formal outside of work. Lots of young people have become 
more interested in suits and vintage clothing last 15 years.  
What other changes have you notices?
Socities in many places have become more diverse in the last twenty years.
People have moved aboard to work. People have become happeir to leave home and work in other citys. 
This may also explain why we are become more communicative than before at least online anyway. We need to keep in touch.
Doctor daily, what other changes have happened?
Well, camara has become cheaper. There are on almost every phone and this has led to selfie. The younger generations are keener on
this type of photo. People are much less private with the photos. And they are taking them, uploading them, and sharing them 
nonstop everyday.
Well, sound like a very interesting book. And when can we buy it?
It's out in shops next month. But available online now.
Dr. Dailly, Dr. Crouch. Thanks for coming in today.
